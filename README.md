## Deliverables for Monte Carlo Methods Course

This repository contains the following deliverables for the Monte Carlo Methods course, part of the Master's degree in Data Science and Machine Learning:

* **Exercise 2: Simulation of Construction Project Timelines**
   - **Objective:** To use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the total time required to complete a construction project, considering dependencies between tasks.

* **Exercise 3: Volume Estimation Using Monte Carlo Methods**
   - **Objective:** To estimate the volume of a geometric region using Monte Carlo methods.
  
* **Exercise 4: Comparison of Worst-Case Criteria Sample Size**
   - **Objective:** To compare and discuss the dependence of worst-case criteria sample size \(n_C\) (Chebyshev), \(n_N\) (Central Limit Theorem), and \(n_H\) (Hoeffding) on the parameters \(\epsilon\) (confidence interval size) and \(\delta\) (confidence interval level).

* **Exercise 5: Volume Estimation Using Monte Carlo Methods (Exercise 3 revisit)**
   - **Objective:** To estimate the volume of a geometric region using Monte Carlo methods, calculating the necessary replications for desired accuracy and estimaging confidence intervals using different statistical criteria.

* **Exercise 6.1: Volume Estimation of a Mountain Using Monte Carlo Methods**
   - **Objective:** To estimate the volume of a conical mountain using Monte Carlo methods, calculating required replications for a specified accuracy and confidence interval.

* **Exercise 6.2: Monte Carlo Integration of a Multivariate Function**
   - **Objective:** To estimate the integral of a multivariate function over a 5-dimensional hypercube using Monte Carlo methods, determining required replications for specified accuracy and evaluating empirical coverage of confidence intervals.

* **Exercise 7: Monte Carlo Estimation of Valid Assignments**
   - **Objective:** To estimate the number of valid ways to assign professors to students based on common languages using Monte Carlo methods, and to evaluate the impact of additional constraints on the number of valid assignments.

* **Exercise 8: Analysis and Application of Internet-Based Random Number Sources**
   - **Objective:** To evaluate and compare internet-based random number sources, modify a previous Monte Carlo exercise to use these sources, and assess the consistency of the results.

* **Exercise 10: Summary of Random Number Generation Paper**
   - **Objective:** To summarize the paper “Software for Uniform Random Number Generation: Distinguishing the Good and the Bad” by P. L’Ecuyer.

* **Exercise 11: Monte Carlo Volume Estimation Using Points in a Circle**
   - **Objective:** To re-solve a volume estimation problem by generating random points within a circle using Monte Carlo methods and compare the precision with a previous approach.

* **Exercise 14: Stratified Sampling for Monte Carlo Integration**
   - **Objective:** To use stratified sampling to calculate the integral of a multivariate function over a 5-dimensional hypercube and compare the results with a previous Monte Carlo approach.

* **Exercise 15: Summary of Risk Analysis Using Monte Carlo Methods Paper**
   - **Objective:** To summarize the paper “Monte Carlo Method in Risk Analysis for Investment Projects” by Victor Platon and Andreea Constantinescu.
